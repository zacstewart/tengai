Column meaning:

TIME

 Prior to 1962, times are UT1. Dates thereafter are UTC. Any 'b' symbol in
the 1st-column denotes a B.C. date. First-column blank (" ") denotes an A.D.
date. Calendar dates prior to 1582-Oct-15 are in the Julian calendar system.
Later calendar dates are in the Gregorian system.

 Time tags refer to the same instant throughout the universe, regardless of
where the observer is located.

 The uniform Coordinate Time scale is used internally. It is equivalent to
the current IAU definition of "TDB". Conversion between CT and the selected
non-uniform UT output scale has not been determined for UTC times after the
next July or January 1st.  The last known leap-second is used over any future
interval.

 NOTE: "n.a." in output means quantity "not available" at the print-time.

R.A._(ICRF/J2000.0)_DEC =
  J2000.0 astrometric right ascension and declination of target center.
Corrected for light-time. Units: HMS (HH MM SS.ff) and DMS (DD MM SS.f)

R.A._(a-apparent)__DEC. =
  Airless apparent right ascension and declination of the target center with
respect to the Earth true-equator and the meridian containing the Earth true
equinox of date.  Corrected for light-time, gravitational deflection of light,
stellar aberration, precession & nutation.
  Units: HMS (HH MM SS.ff) and DMS (DD MM SS.f)

dRA*cosD d(DEC)/dt =
   The rate of change of target center apparent RA and DEC (airless).
d(RA)/dt is multiplied by the cosine of the declination.
   Units: ARCSECONDS PER HOUR

X & Y satellite coordinates & position angle =
  Satellite differential coordinates WRT the primary body along with the
satellite position angle. Differential coordinates are defined in RA as
X=[(RA_sat - RA_primary)*COS(DEC_primary)], in DEC as Y=(DEC_sat-DEC_primary).
Non-Lunar satellites only. "SatPANG" is the angle from the North Celestial
Pole measured counter-clockwise (CCW, or east) to a line from primary/planet
center to satellite center.
  Units: ARCSECONDS (X & Y) and DEGREES (position angle)

APmag S-brt =
  Target's approximate apparent visual magnitude & surface brightness. For
planets and satellites, values are available only for solar phase angles in the
range generally visible from Earth. This is to avoid extrapolation of models
beyond their valid (data-based) limits.  Units: NONE & VISUAL MAGNITUDES PER
SQUARE ARCSECOND

Illu% =
  Fraction of target circular disk illuminated by Sun (phase), as seen by
observer.  Units: PERCENT

Def_illu =
  Defect of illumination. Maximum angular width of target circular disk
diameter not illuminated by the Sun.  Units: ARCSECONDS

ang-sep/v =
 Target-primary angular separation and visibility. The angle between the
center of target object and the center of the primary body it revolves around,
as seen by the observer. Units: ARCSECONDS

 Non-lunar natural satellite visibility codes (limb-to-limb):
   /t = Transitting primary body disk,  /O = Occulted by primary body disk,
   /p = Partial umbral eclipse,         /P = Occulted partial umbral eclipse,
   /u = Total umbral eclipse,           /U = Occulted total umbral eclipse,
   /- = Target is the primary body,     /* = None of above ("free and clear")

Ang-diam =
  The equatorial angular width of the target body full disk, if it were
fully visible to the observer.  Units: ARCSECONDS

Ob-lon Ob-lat =
  Apparent planetographic ("geodetic") longitude and latitude (IAU2006 model)
of the center of the target disk seen by the OBSERVER at print-time. Light
travel-time from target to observer is taken into account. Latitude is the
angle between the equatorial plane and the line perpendicular to the reference
ellipsoid of the body (e.g., reflects body oblateness). Positive longitude
is to the west.  Units: DEGREES

Sl-lon Sl-lat =
  Apparent sub-solar planetographic ("geodetic") longitude and latitude of the
Sun (IAU2006) as seen by the observer at print-time. Light travel-time from Sun
to target and from target to observer is taken into account.  Latitude is the
angle between the equatorial plane and the line perpendicular to the reference
ellipsoid of the body (e.g., reflects body oblateness). Positive longitude
is to the west.  Units: DEGREES

SN.ang SN.ds =
 Target sub-solar point position angle (CCW, or east, with respect to the
direction of the true-of-date Celestial North Pole) and its' angular distance
from the sub-observer point (center of disk) at print time. Negative distance
indicates sub-solar point on hidden hemisphere. Units: DEGREES and ARCSECONDS

NP.ang NP.ds =
 Target's North pole position angle (CCW, or east, with respect to
direction of true-of-date Celestial North Pole) and its' angular distance
from the sub-observer point (center of disk) at observation time.
Negative distance indicates the planet's North pole is on the hidden
hemisphere.  Units: DEGREES and ARCSECONDS

hEcl-Lon hEcl-Lat =
   Geometric heliocentric J2000 ecliptic longitude and latitude of target
center at the instant light leaves it to be observed at print time (print time
minus 1-way light-time).  Units: DEGREES

r       rdot =
  Heliocentric range ("r", light-time corrected) and range-rate ("rdot")
of the target center at the instant light seen by the observer at print-time
would have left the target center (print-time minus down-leg light-time).
The Sun-to-target distance traveled by a ray of light emanating from the
center of the Sun that reaches the target center point at some instant and
is recordable by the observer one down-leg light-time later at print-time.
Units: AU and KM/S

delta  deldot =
  Range ("delta") and range-rate ("delta-dot") of target center with respect
to the observer at the instant light seen by the observer at print-time would
have left the target center (print-time minus down-leg light-time); the
distance traveled by a light ray emanating from the center of the target and
recorded by the observer at print-time. "deldot" is a projection of the
velocity vector along this ray, the light-time-corrected line-of-sight from the
coordinate center, and indicates relative motion. A positive "deldot" means the
target center is moving away from the observer (coordinate center). A negative
"deldot" means the target center is moving toward the observer.
Units: AU and KM/S

1-way_LT =
  1-way down-leg light-time from target center to observer. The elapsed time
since light (observed at print-time) would have left or reflected off a point
at the center of the target. Units: MINUTES

VmagSn VmagOb =
  Magnitude of target center velocity wrt Sun ("VmagSn") and the observer
("VmagOb") at the time light left the target center to be observed (print
time minus 1-way light-time).  These are absolute values of the velocity
vectors (total speeds) and do not indicate direction of motion.  Units: KM/S

S-O-T /r =
   Sun-Observer-Target angle; target's apparent solar elongation seen from
observer location at print-time. If negative, the target center is behind
the Sun. Angular units: DEGREES.

   The '/r' column is a Sun-relative code, output for observing sites
with defined rotation models only.

        /T indicates target trails Sun (evening sky)
        /L indicates target leads Sun  (morning sky)

   NOTE: The S-O-T solar elongation angle is the total separation in any
direction. It does not indicate the angle of Sun leading or trailing.

S-T-O =
  Sun-Target-Observer (~ PHASE ANGLE) angle: the vertex angle at target center
formed by a vector to the apparent center of the Sun and a vector intersecting
the observer at print-time. This measurable angle is within 20 arcseconds
(0.006 deg) of the reduced PHASE ANGLE at observer's location at print time.
The difference is due to down-leg stellar aberration affecting measured target
position but not apparent solar illumination direction.  When computing phase,
Horizons uses the true phase angle, not S-T-O, but the resulting difference
in illuminated fraction is less than 0.001%.
  Units: DEGREES


T-O-M/Illu% =
  Target-Observer-Moon/Illuminated percentage. The apparent lunar elongation
angle between target body CENTER and the Moon's CENTER, seen from the observing
site, along with fraction of the lunar disk illuminated by the Sun. A negative
lunar elongation angle indicates the target center is behind the Moon.
Units: DEGREES & PERCENT.

O-P-T =
  Observer-Primary-Target angle; apparent angle between a target satellite,
its primary's center and an observer, at observing location, at print time.
Units: DEGREES

PsAng PsAMV =
  The position angles of the extended Sun->target radius vector ("PsAng")
and the negative of the target's heliocentric velocity vector ("PsAMV"),
as seen in the observer's plane-of-sky, measured CCW (east) from reference
frame North Celestial Pole. Small-bodies only. Units: DEGREES.

PlAng =
  Angle between observer and target orbital plane, measured from center
of target at the moment light seen at observation time leaves the target.
Positive values indicate observer is above the object's orbital plane, in
the direction of reference frame +z axis. Small-bodies only. Units: DEGREES.

Cnst =
  Constellation ID; the 3-letter abbreviation for the name of the
constellation containing the target center's astrometric position,
as defined by IAU (1930) boundary delineation.  See documentation
for list of abbreviations.

CT-UT =
  Difference between uniform Coordinate Time scale and Earth-rotation
dependent Universal Time. Prior to 1962, the difference is with respect
to UT1 (CT-UT1).  For 1962 and later, the delta is with respect to UTC
(CT-UTC).  Values beyond the next July or January 1st may change if a
leap-second is introduced. Units: SECONDS

ObsEcLon ObsEcLat =
  Observer-centered Earth ecliptic-of-date longitude and latitude of the
target center's apparent position, corrected for light-time, the gravitational
deflection of light and stellar aberration. Although centered on the observer,
the values are expressed relative to coordinate basis directions defined by
the Earth's true equator-plane, equinox direction, and mean ecliptic plane at
print time.  Units: DEGREES

N.Pole-RA  N.Pole-DC
   ICRF/J2000.0 Right Ascension and Declination (IAU2006 rotation model)
of target body's North Pole direction at the time light left the body to
be observed at print time. Units: DEGREES

GlxLon GlxLat =
  Observer-centered Galactic System II (post WW II) longitude and latitude
of the target center's apparent position. Corrected for light-time,
gravitational deflection of light and stellar aberration. Units: DEG DEG
